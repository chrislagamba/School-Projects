# INFORM-SQL-Project
SQL project for INFORM


This is an individual class project for my Introdução à Informática na Saúde course. The goal of the project was
to complete data analysis and visualisation using a combination of SQL and Python using data obtained from the 
UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/102/thyroid+disease).
The data file selected (hypothyroid.data) was obtained from the Thyroid Disease repository.

Data analysis and visualisation was performed using the Google Colab environment. Column names for the data set 
were obtained from the hypothyroid.names file packaged with the data set.
