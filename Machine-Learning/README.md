## Description
This folder contains the projects I completed for my machine learning class.

Assignment 1: Used decision tree and random forest models for classification (e.g., positive cervical cancer diagnosis).

Assignment 2: Used support vector machine models (linear, radial, and polynomial kernels) for classification (e.g., positive cervical cancer diagnosis). I also used principal components analysis/principal components regression and LASSO models for variable selection in the final SVM model as my approach.

Assignment 3: Compared ensemble approaches (bagging, boosting, and stacked models).

Assignment 4: Practice exploiting the data using association rules and clustering.

Assignment 5: Practice simulating  data stream with set parameters and alarms.
