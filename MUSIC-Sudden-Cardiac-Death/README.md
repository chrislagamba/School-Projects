# Laboratory Project on Intelligent Data Analysis

## Introduction and Objectives
This course was designed to emphasize teamwork, critical thinking, and the use of visualization tools to make data more accessible and understandable.

## Assignment Instructions
Students will work in groups to select a dataset, conduct a data analysis, and develop a dashboard or interface to effectively communicate their findings.

## Project Description
My group chose the MUSIC (Sudden Cardiac Death in Chronic Heart Failure) dataset available at: https://physionet.org/content/music-sudden-cardiac-death/1.0.1/. The dataset includes 992 participants with NYHA Class II or III heart failure. There are 103 variables for each participant.

We used the dataset to determine the 4-year risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) based on participants who experienced SCD during study follow-up. We developed an SCD risk calculator to determine a patient's risk of SCD within the next 4 years using the most prominent variables from our analysis of the dataset.

 Analysis was completed using R since it is the "standard" for our program. 

## Data Files
'labF.ipynb' is our analysis of the dataset.

'MUSIC BI.pbix' is our dashboard that was developed using PowerBI.

'SCDcalculator-Shiny.R' is our SCD risk calculator that was developed for deployment in Shiny. A deployed version of the calculator may be found here: https://batman2025.shinyapps.io/SCD_Calculator/
